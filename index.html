							<h2>Data-Driven Approach to Improve Telemarketing in Banking</h2>
							<p>Predicting customer engagement using machine learning.</p>
						</header>
						<p><b>Domain:</b> Marketing plays a key role in business, banks included.
							It allows businesses to raise awareness of the products or services
							they offer, differentiate their products from competitors by educating
							their customers or potential customers. The information gathered ranges from
							things such as; age, types of loans the person has (home or auto),
							marital status and education level among many others.</p>
						<p>
							<b>Objective:</b> The goal is to build a binary classification model with our
							data set to gain a better understanding of what type of demographic
							is more likely to open a term deposit than not.
							We evaluate how accurate our models are at making these predictions.
							There is immense value in being able to predict what demographic is more
							likely to subscribe to a certain product or service a business may offer.

							<h2>Canadian Govt. Sustainability Goal Analysis</h2>
							<p>Analyzing the Canadian Government's Initiatives to Reduce Carbon Footprint</p>
						</header>
						<p><b>Domain:</b> Climate change is a global issue that has been a growing
							concern for governments worldwide. Burning of fossil
							fuels for numerous reasons generates green house gases
							that will in turn act as a blanket wrapped around our
							planet trapping sun’s heat and causing rise in global
							temperature commonly called global warming.</p>
						<p>
							<b>Objective:</b> We analyze the Canadian Government's
							initiatives toward achieving its net-zero emission goal and
							the impact of these initiatives on renewable energy production
							and consumption across provinces. We focused on analyzing energy
							consumption and emissions by the government facilities, industries
							and by residents using SQL queries with database hosted on Google Cloud Platform.
							We combine all the data and query to make a holistic comment on how the sustainability goals
							are being handled by the Canadian Government so far.

						<h2>Data Story: Mobile & Technology Survey</h2>

					</header>
					<p>
						<b>Domain:</b> The impact of mobile phones and technology on emerging economic
						countries has been transformative.In order to better
						understand the role of technology in our society,
						we analyze the results of PewResearch's "Mobile and Technology - 2018"
						telephone survey. This survey focuses on three key areas: how people use their
						mobile phones, the impact of social media and technology, and how these factors
						intersect with politics.
					</p>
					<p>
						<b>Objective:</b> Through this analysis, we gain a
						thorough understanding of the benefits and drawbacks that
						technology brings to our lives. We also forecast an individual's perspective on their
						standard of living based on their demographic details and overall
						political inclinations using ML models such as  LDA, PCA, t-SNE, and SVC.

								<h2>Medical Cost Prediction</h2>
								<p>Predicting customer engagement using machine learning.</p>
							</header>
							<p><b>Domain:</b> Medical expenses are one of the significant recurring expenses in
								human life. The rising cost of healthcare is an essential concern
								for many individuals and families. It is common knowledge that a person's
								lifestyle and various physical parameters dictate diseases or
								ailments one can have, and these ailments dictate medical expenses.</p>
							<p>
								<b>Objective:</b> We find a correlation between personal medical expenses and
								different factors and compare them. Then we use the prominent
								attributes as predictors to predict medical costs by creating
								linear regression models and comparing them using ANOVA.
								Our findings provide insights into the factors driving
								medical costs and inform strategies for managing healthcare expenses.

								<h2>Ecommerce Sales Analysis</h2>
								<p>Statistical approach towards online clothes sales analysis</p>

							<p><b>Domain:</b> At one point in history, a pair of good, clean clothes were considered a
								necessity, but times have changed.Shopping and especially buying new
								clothes is a leisure activity for many people. This is the domain we
								are tackling in this project. We choose the e-commerce sale for
								July 2020 of summer clothes on the Wish.com website. Wish is an e-commerce
								company that sells varieties of clothing as well as accessories and is
								based in the UK.</p>
							<p>
								<b>Objective:</b> We see how a marketing or sales team can
								improve their sales, overall product rating or consider making changes to
								their offering. Focus was kept on sales, price, product ratings, fast shipping,
								quality and product color. We start with visual explanatory analysis followed by
								bootstrapping, hypothesis testing, prop test and permutation test.

								<h2>World Financial Healthcare</h2>

							<p><b>Domain:</b> Health is an essential aspect of every country’s overall well-being. The general health of its population
								and their access to healthcare is an especially important way of determining the country’ responsibilities
								towards its people. Even though in some countries, access to healthcare is considered a basic right, this
								varies from country to country based on numerous factors.</p>
							<p>
								<b>Objective:</b> We discuss how much each country spends on healthcare, we find a unique
								combination of two different yet closely related aspects: Health and Finance. We discuss the difference in expenditure of Developed and Developing countries and take several
								parameters to identify why there is a difference and how we can minimize it.
								Moreover, we discuss how an unprecedented event like COVID affects financial healthcare.
